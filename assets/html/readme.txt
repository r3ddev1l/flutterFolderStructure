If our application needs to open some HTML content which we need to add in our mobile app (Generally the licensed content of the application or any .html files which we need to load in the application using the package: webview_flutter or flutter_html)
Note: Generally webview_flutter is used to load the URL of any web content but we can use this plugin for showing the HTML content which is stored locally in the mobile application. I will prepare a separate article explaining how to show local HTML files in flutter and will add the link here when completed.
